# Contributing

### General

1. **[Open an Issue](https://github.com/tycrek/degoogle/issues/new/choose) before opening a Pull Request**. We can use Issue's for discussion on adding/removing/modifying alternatives.
2. **English only** for Issues & Pull Requests.
3. As of May 25 2020, the `README.md` file is automatically generated. Please edit anything in `yaml/` or `md/`.
4. If you submitted a change that made it into the guide but don't have your Reddit or GitHub username in the [CONTRIBUTORS.md](../master/CONTRIBUTORS.md) list, open an Issue or Pull Request so we can fix it, or update your existing Issue with the request. Alternatively, if your username is on the list and you do *not* want it there, feel free to request this as well.

### New alternatives

1. **Use the Issue template.**
2. **Fill out as much info as you can**. This makes it easier for maintainers to quickly approve changes.
2. Limit yourself to **one** alternative per Issue.
7. Check to see if the alternative you want added already exists in the guide.

### Removing alternatives

1. **No personal opinions** on why a service should be removed. Links to articles with details is much more helpful.
2. Limit yourself to **one** alternative per Issue.
